Project: MIPS RISC Architeture CPU Emulator
Author:Michael Davis
Descripton: This is an emulator for a MIPS assembly CPU I created as a project for my computer architecture class, I have included a makefile so it can be compiled easily from the command line using make. The output executable is named simulator. The executable takes a .mips assembly code file as an input argument. The program executes the instrutions given in the file then displays the nops(bubbles) used to synchronize the pipeline as well as the flushes required. It also displays the RAW hazards incurred and avoided and where they occurred.
